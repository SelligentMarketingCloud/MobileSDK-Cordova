/*!
 *  In-Application-Message (IAM) is an optional service which will **automatically** retrieve messages from the back-end at specific frequencies.
 *  Once new messages were retrieved, the library notifies the application about it.
 *  Then, the application may display any IAM as a usual notification.
 *
 *  The retrieved IAM share the exact same format as the remote-notification.
 *  However, they are not live messages and, therefore should NOT be considered as an alternative to remote-notification.
 *  Remote-push-notificaitons are almost live messages that are pushed to devices.
 *  While IAM are non-live-messages that the SDK fetch at specific intervals according to provided fetch-mode.
 *
 *  ##Implementation:
 *  In a nutshell, activate the IAM-service is a two steps process:
 *
 *  *   First, create an SMManagerSettingIAM instance and inject it in SMManagerSetting with [SMManagerSetting configureInAppMessageServiceWithSetting:]
 *  *   Then, enable the IAM-service with enableInAppMessage:
 *
 *  However, additional steps might be required according to desired fetching-mode. 
 *  Each of these steps are explained in further details bellow.
 *
 *  In order to be notified about new IAM, the application must register to correct notification *kSMNotification_Event_DidReceiveInAppMessage*
 *  (Please read SMNSNotification for additional information).
 *  This notification will provide you with the IAM's unique ID.
 *  Please be aware that it’s the unique application’s chance to capture and store that information.
 *
 *  ##Displaying IAM
 *
 *  As IAM and remote-notification share the same format, they are both displayed using the same APIs.
 *  Please read the documentation in SMManager(RemoteNotification) to know how to display any kind of notification.
 *
 *  Since sdk v 2.5 you have the possibility to store the In App Message on your side and process them the way you want
 *  In order to do that, once you are notified that In App Messages are available you can call getInAppMessages to receive a NSArray of SMInAppMessage
 *  Once a SMInAppMessage has been displayed and has been seen by the user you need to call setInAppMessageAsSeen: to inform Selligent that the In App message has been opened
 *  In case there is links in the In App Message and in case one of the link is triggered by user please call executeLinkAction:: to process the action related to the link and inform Selligent that the link has been clicked
 *
 *  ##Fetching modes
 *  IAM may be retrieved from two different modes corresponding to the application's state:
 *
 *  * Foreground-fetch -- When the application is in foreground.
 *  * Background-fetch -- When the application is in background.
 *
 *  Each of these modes is **optional**. In other words, you can use one mode or the other, or even both at the same time.
 *  Choosing the adequate mode depends on the application's need and can be managed by the application's developper.
 *  Off course, to allow the SDK to retrieve IAM as fast as possible, we recommand using both modes at the same time.
 *
 *  Following documentation explains how to activate each mode:
 *
 *  ##Fetching IAM in foreground
 *  In order to retrieve IAM while the application is running, make sure to do the folllowing:
 *
 *  - Create and configure an SMManagerSettingIAM instance accordingly.
 *  - Provide the created SMManagerSettingIAM instance to SMManager before starting the library
 *  - Enable In App message by calling enableInAppMessage: when your application needs it.
 *
 *  ##Fetching IAM in background
 *  Initially, this mode has been added as a complementary-option to the foreground-mode.
 *  However, it can be used as a single-fetch-mode if fits best your application's need.
 *  
 *  To understand better how often the OS will execute the background-fetch, make sure to read the following [Apple-documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/BackgroundExecution/BackgroundExecution.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH4-SW56)
 *
 *  In order to support this mode, make sure to :
 *
 *  - Create the SMManagerSettingIAM instance accordingly.
 *  - Provide the created SMManagerSettingIAM instance to SMManager before starting the library.
 *  - In the application's target, enable the following: Capabilities > Background Modes > Background Fetch
 *  - Implement performFetchWithCompletionHandler: in UIApplicaiton's delegate (under delegate method application:performFetchWithCompletionHandler:)
 *  - Enable In App message by calling enableInAppMessage: when your application needs it.
