/**
 *  In addition to the implementation of category SMManager(RemoteNotification), this category will supply a support of iOS 10 and usage of UserNotifications framework
 *
 *  Make sure to read the category SMManager(RemoteNotification) to learn more about remote-notification for support of iOS version 8 and 9 and to correctly register for remote notification.
 *
 *  If you build against iOS 10+ and you use UserNotifications framework we then recommend you to implement those 2 methods of UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate in your appdelegate:
 *
 *      - SMManager didReceiveNotificationResponse:
 *      - SMManager didReceiveNotificationResponse:withCompletionHandler:
 *      - SMManager willPresentNotification:
 *      - SMManager willPresentNotification:withCompletionHandler:
 *
 *  Register your appdelegate to the UNUserNotificationCenter by adding the following two lines in the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions delegate.
 *
 *   `UNUserNotificationCenter *center = [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter];`
 *
 *   `center.delegate = self;`
 *
 *
 * __Notification extensions__
 *
 * In this category you will also find the support for notification extensions target (content and service)
 *
 *      Init extensions (to be used for each extensions that will be added to your project):
 *
 *          - SMManager startExtensionWithSetting:
 *
 *      Notification content extension :
 *
 *          - SMManager didReceiveNotification:
 *
 *      Notification service extension :
 *
 *          - SMManager didReceiveNotificationRequest:
 *          - SMManager didReceiveNotificationRequest:withContentHandler:
 *          - SMManager serviceExtensionTimeWillExpire
 *
