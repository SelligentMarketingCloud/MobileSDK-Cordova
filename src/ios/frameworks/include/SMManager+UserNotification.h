/**
 *  In addition to the implementation of category SMManager(RemoteNotification), this category will supply a support of iOS 10 and usage of UserNotifications framework
 *
 *  Make sure to read the category SMManager(RemoteNotification) to learn more about remote-notification for support of iOS version 8 and 9 and to correctly register for remote notification.
 *
 *  If you build against iOS 10+ and you use UserNotifications framework we then recommend you to implement those 2 methods of UNUserNotificationCenterDelegate in your appdelegate:
 *
 *  - willPresentNotification:withCompletionHandler:
 *  - didReceiveNotificationResponse:withCompletionHandler:
 *
 *  Register your appdelegate to the UNUserNotificationCenter by adding the following two lines in the didFinishLaunchingWithOptions delegate.
 *
 *  @code
 *   UNUserNotificationCenter *center = [UNUserNotificationCenter currentNotificationCenter];
 *   center.delegate = self;
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  #SMManager+UserNotifications :#
