/**
 *  This class allow you to configure the SMManager.
 *  Such instance must be created before starting the library.
 *  Creating an SMManagerSetting's instance is pretty straightforward as there's only [one constructor for doing so](settingWithUrl:ClientID:PrivateKey:).
 *  This sole constructor is sufficent to get you started. 
 *
 *  Additional parameters described in this header will provide you with additional control and ***are all optional***.
 *
 *  ##Being user-friendly
 *  When the application is in foreground and receive a remote-notification, by default, the library will display it on the current visible UIViewController. This behaviour might be unwanted and may disturb the user if he appears to navigate in a different context. Should you want to prevent that behaviour and display the remote-notification shortly after (when the user will be in a more appropriate context), please follow these steps :
 *
 *  *   Create an SMManagerSetting with the default constructor as usual.
 *  *   Set shouldDisplayRemoteNotification to FALSE.
 *  *   Start the library as usual [SMManager startWithLaunchOptions:Setting:]
 *  *   Listen to NSNotification-name: _kSMNotification_Event_DidReceiveRemoteNotification_ (declared in SMNSNotification)
 *
 *  At this point, remote-notification are NOT displayed when the application is in foreground. (Other application's state are not affected).
 *  Then, displaying the remote-notification is up to the application and can be done at any time by :
 *
 *  *   Retrieve the last remote-notification with [SMManager(RemoteNotification) retrieveLastRemotePushNotification]
 *  *   Display the notification according to its ID with [SMManager(RemoteNotification) displayNotificationID:]
 *
 *  Or, more straightforwardly :
 *
 *  *   Display the last known remote notification by calling : [SMManager(RemoteNotification) displayLastReceivedRemotePushNotification]
 *
 *  ##IAM
 *  In-Application-Message-service is configurable using SMManagerSettingIAM which you'll inject using the API configureInAppMessageServiceWithSetting:
 *  A dedicated topic regarding this topic can be found in SMManager(InAppMessage)
 *
 *  ##IAC
 *  In-Application-Content-service is configurable using SMManagerSettingIAC which you'll inject using the API configureInAppContentServiceWithSetting:
 *  A dedicated topic regarding this topic can be found in SMManager(InAppContent)

 *  @warning This property does not have an impact when [SMManager(RemoteNotification) displayNotificationID:] or  [SMManager(RemoteNotification) displayLastReceivedRemotePushNotification] are called.

 *
 *  @discussion Once a new remote-notification is received, if it contains in the payload  datas for an inapp message, this setting will add the inapp message to the in app messages list . You will need to listen to  kSMNotification_Event_DidReceiveInAppMessage NSNotification  to be informed  that an inapp message is available and you can then retrieve it with [SMManager(InAppMessages) getInAppMessages]  helper method and use in an inbox for example
 *  by default the in app message will be displayed if you wish to display it by yourself you will need to provide a class by calling [SMManager(InAppMessage) inAppMessageDelegate:] .

/**
 *  This value tells how often the SDK's cache mechanism should clear itself.
 *
 *  @discussion Internally, each notification-messages has a life-span.
 *  Clearing the cache stands for deleting notification-messages with an expired life-span.
 *  In other words, only old notification-messages are deletesd from the cache.
 *  More recent ones are kept in memory until their life-span expires and a new clearCache is called.
 *  By default, this value is set to kSMClearCache_Auto.
 *  Configuring this value highly depends of how frequently the application will query specific notification-messages.
 *  As if the application query a notification-message which is not in the cache anymore, it will automaticaly fetch it from the backend.
 *  In other words, it depends how often you call the API [SMManager(RemoteNotification) displayNotificationID:].
 *
 *  In a nutshell:
 *
 *  *   If the application will never query [SMManager(RemoteNotification) displayNotificationID:], we recommend keeping this value to default.
 *  *   If the application use IAM-service, we recommend keeping this value to default.
 *  *   On the other hand, if the application abuse [SMManager(RemoteNotification) displayNotificationID:], we recommend selecting a value higher than the default one according to your application's need.
 *
 *  @warning As soon as IAM-service is enabled, the SDK will consider kSMClearCache_Weekly as being the default value. Except if you explicitly overide the property.
 *  In 99% of the cases, you should not overide this property as the SDK is smart enough to handle the cache mechanism by itself.
 *  Keep also in mind that this behavior  is only applicable for notification and IAM that doesn't have a n expiration date set
