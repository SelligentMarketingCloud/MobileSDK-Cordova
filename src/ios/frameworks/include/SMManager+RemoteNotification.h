/**
 *  This category contains the basic step-by-step implementation to get you started.
 *  Make sure to read the category SMManager(SilentPush) to learn more about background-remote-notification.
 *
 *  #Handling Remote Notifications:#
 *  In order to receive remote-notification from the back-end,  all the following methods must be included in you application's delegate:
 *
 *  - didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:
 *  - didRegisterUserNotificationSettings:
 *  - didFailToRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithError:
 *  - didReceiveRemoteNotification:
 *
 *  Finally, make sure to call registerForRemoteNotification according to your application's need.
 *
 *  #Receiving Remote Notifications:#
 *  When a remote-notification is received, the library will automatically display a custom UIViewController.
 *  Should you want to prevent this behaviour, feel free to configure the SMManagerSetting accordingly before starting the SMManager.
 *
 *  Before displaying the remote-notification's UIVIewController, the library will broadcast an NSNotification offering the application a chance to pause any ongoing heavy task.
 *  The same principle is applied before dismissing the UIVIewController providing the application the opportunity to start again the paused heavy-task.
 *
 *  Finally, should you want to know when the user interact with UIViewController's control, an NSNotification is also posted providing information about the selected element.
 *  For additionnal information about NSNotification processing and handling, please check SMNSNotification
 *
 *  #Displaying notification :#
 *  The application can display any notification based on its ID using the API displayNotificationID:
 *  These IDs can be retrieved from broadcasted NSNotification.
 *  (Please read SMNSNotification for additional information).
 *
 *  A convenient method is provided to display the last received remote-notification using displayLastReceivedRemotePushNotification
 *
 *  #SMManager+RemoteNotification :#
